NEXT JS 

FRONTEND WEB D FRAMEWORK CREATED BY VERCEL WHICH ENABLES SERVER SIDE RENDERING AND STATIC SITE GENERATION.

SERVER SIDE RENDERING :
IN CASE OF NORMAL REACT APP, ENTIRE APPLICATION IS FIRST LOADED AND RENDERED ON CLIENT. IN NEXT JS IT ALLOWS THE FIRST PAGE TO BE LOADED BY SERVER WHICH IS GREAT FOR SEO & PERFORMANCE. IN NORMAL REACT (CLIENT SIDE RENDERING) APPS, IF WE SEE SOURCE CODE, NO CONTENT IS THERE, BAD FOR SEO, BUT IN CASE OF NEXT JS, FIRST PAGE CONTENT IS THERE.

OTHER BENEFITS:
EASY ROUTING
API ROUTES
TYPESCRIPT N SASS 
EASY DEPLOYMENT
